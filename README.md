## FUNCTIONALITIES
* Anyone can be registered as a user. There are three different roles for users, 'admin', 'moderator' and 'general'. By default the very first user will get the role 'Admin', and the subseqent users will get the role 'General'. The Admin can modify any user's role, and can set a new role from any of these theree roles. That means any 'general' user can be an 'admin' or a 'moderator'. 
* A user who has a role 'general', can write a 'thread', edit or delete the own thread and can comment to other's thread.
* Moderator has the same access as general user. Moreover moderator has the power to modify or delete any user's Thread.
* Admin can create Sub-Forum, have all the access as like as general-user or moderator.
